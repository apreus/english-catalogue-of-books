ANALYSIS OF BOOKS
PUBLISHED DURING 1918 IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.
a
THE PUBLISHERS' CIRCULAR AND BOOK-
SELLERS' RECORD records a total of
7.716 books as having been published
during the year 1918. This is a decrease
of 415 compared with the previous year ;
but when it is remembered that the
period has been one of the utmost diffi-
culty owing to the exhaustion of labour
and materials and the enormously
increased cost of production in the fourth
and fifth years of the War, the total is
one which gives striking proof of the
vitality and enterprise of British publish-
ing. The decrease is accounted for
chiefly by a falling off in the number of
works of Fiction (-523) and Juvenile
Literature (-155); other classes that have
also decreased slightly are Education,
Agriculture, Domestic, Business, History,
and Geography. On the other hand,
Sociology has increased by 112, Technology
by 110, Medicine by 80, and Poetry by
98; and there are smaller increases in
Religion, Fine Arts, Literature, Military
and Naval, and Description.
Viewing the general totals, it will be
noted that new publications have
increased by 144, while the number of
new editions has dropped by 559. An
extraordinary proportion of outstanding
works have appeared during the year,
and the automatic curtailment of produc-
tion of minor books owing to the scarcity
and cost of materials may not have been
an unmixed evil from the literary point
of view.
The total number of books published
in the various classes of literature is a
rough indication of theattention bestowed
by the public upon them, and it is
interesting to compare the order in which
the principal classes appear this year and
in 1914 -

It should be noted that in the following
table “ Education ” includes only books
about educational theory and practice,
and not text books on special subjects,
which are classed elsewhere; that under
Music only works about music are
recorded ; and that books dealing gener-
ally with the European War are classed
under " History," while tho.e of
technical nature are placed under the
heading "Military and Naval." It
would be possible to Swell the total to a
much greater figure by counting numerous
leaflets (Government and other), ephem-
eral pamphlets, the publications of
borough councils and other local govern-
ment bodies, and musical texts. While
it is obvious that our total could be
increased greatly by the inclusion of all
this literary protozoa, the figures would
not represent so accurately the book
publishing activity of the United King-
dom,
In these tables each publication is
counted as one, whether it is in one or
more volumes. Serials that appear later
as a collected volume are counted as an
ordinary book on the appearance of that
volume; so that, for example, the series
of “ Statutory Rules and Orders" issued
by the Government, and amounting to
several hundred ir the year, are counted
as one item on the appearance of the
annual collected volume. The same
rule applies to volumes of magazines, &c.
Further detailed information regarding
the year's publishing is supplied by the
appended analytical tables.

PREFATORY NOTE
This eighty-second yearly issue of THE ENGLISH CATALOGUE OF Books comprises
the titles (under authors, and subjects or titles) of works published during 1918,
and also of some received too late for inclusion in the eighty-first issue.
The main entry for each book begins with the author's surname (if known)
in heavy type. As an index to these "Author" records, entries are also made
under the titles, commencing with their most important words (which usually
indicate the subjects with which the books deal), or with the first words; the
name or word under which the main entry appears is printed in italics in these
index entries, thus giving a reference to the place where the full information
about a book may be found. Main entries and index entries are in one alphabet.
Writers with compound names are entered under the first part of the name,
e.g. :
Baring-Gould (Sabine)
and accordingly must be looked for in that order. References are also made,
however, from the last part of the name.
The publications of learned Societies are recorded in an Appendix.
The names and addresses of the Publishers of Great Britain and Ireland,
followed by those of the principal publishers in the United States and Canada,
will be found at the end of the volume. The telegraphic and cable addresses
and telephone numbers have been added when known.
Following the Preface is an analysis of the books of the year 1918, showing
in detail the number of works in each class of literature, and giving the proportions
of new books, translations, pamphlets, and new editions.
Every effort has been made to obtain the full particulars of the tooks noted.
Special enquiries were made in every case where information was deficient; and
most publishers courteously responded. In the cases where entries have been
included without prices, the fault lies with the publishers concerned.
Hearty thanks are due to the many publishers, secretaries, librarians, authors
and bibliographers who have assisted in making this book more correct and
comprehensive than it would have been otherwise.
The Editor will be glad to have particulars (author, title, size, price, publisher,
and month of publication) of any work which may have been omitted Information
regarding each book should be given on a separate slip of paper or postcard
It should be addressed to The Editor of THE ENGLISH CATALOGUE OF Books,
“Publishers' Circular" Office, 19. Adam Street, Strand, London, W C. 2,
THE EDITOR.

name or word under which the main entry appears is printed in italics in these
index entries, thus giving a reference to the place where the full information
about a book may be found. Main entries and index entries are in one alphabet.
Writers with compound names are entered under the first part of the name,
6.8. :-
Baring-Gould (Sabine)
and accordingly must be looked for in that order. References are also made,
however, from the last part of the name.
The publications of learned Societies are recorded in an Appendix.
The names and addresses of the Publishers of Great Britain and Ireland,
followed by those of the principal publishers in the United States and Canada,
will be found at the end of the volume. The telegraphic and cable addresses
and telephone numbers have been added when known.
Following the Preface is an analysis of the books of the year 1918, showing
in detail the number of works in each class of literature, and giving the proportions
of new books, translations, pamphlets, and new editions.
Every effort has been made to obtain the full particulars of the books noted.
Special enquiries were made in every case where information was deficient; and
most publishers courteously responded. In the cases where entries have been
included without prices, the fault lies with the publishers concerned.
Hearty thanks are due to the many publishers, secretaries, librarians, authors
and bibliographers who have assisted in making this book more correct and
comprehensive than it would have been otherwise.
The Editor will be glad to have particulars (author, title, size, price, publisher
and month of publication) of any work which may have been omitted Information
regarding each book should be given on a separate slip of paper or postcard
It should be addressed to The Editor of THE ENGLISH CATALOGUE OF Books,
“Publishers' Circular" Office, 19, Adam Street, Strand, London, W C. 2.

DIRECTORY OF PUBLISHERS
Publishers are invited to send us their Telegraphic Addresses and Telephone Numbers.
Those sent will be found below between square brackets [ ), and separated froin each other by a semicolon (;)
The Editor will be glad to be notified of any inaccuracy in the following lists for correction in subsequent volumes.
This list of Publishers, with their Addresses, has been compiled principally with a view to supplying
information regarding the books in the English Catalogue. This will explain the inclusion of some
firms in the list who can scarcely, in the strict acceptation of the term, be called Publishers, since the publication
of books forms only an occasional part of their business.
