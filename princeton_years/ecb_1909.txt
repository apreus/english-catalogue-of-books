PREFATORY NOTE
THIS seventy-third yearly issue of the English Catalogue of Books comprises
the titles (under authors, and subjects or titles) of works published during
1909 and also of some received too late for inclusion in the seventy-second
issue.
name
The main entry of each book begins with the author's surname (if known)
in heavy type. As an index to these Author” records, entries are also
made under the titles, commencing with its most important word (which usually
indicates the subject dealt with by each book), or with the first word; the
or word under which the main entry appears is printed in italics in
these index entries, thus giving a reference to the place where the full infor-
mation about a book may be found. Main entries and index entries are in
one alphabet.
Writers with compound names are entered under the last part of the
naine, e.g.:
Gould (Sabine Baring-)
and accordingly must be looked for in that order.
The publications of Learned Societies are recorded in an Appendix.
The names and addresses of the Publishers of Great Britain and Ireland
will be found at the end of the volume, followed by those of the principal
Publishers in the United States and Canada. The telegraphic and cable
addresses and telephone numbers have been added when known.
Following the Preface is an analysis of the books of the year 1909, showing
in detail the number of works in each class of literature and giving the pro-
portions of new books and new editions.
Hearty thanks are due to many publishers, secretaries, librarians, Jauthors,
and bibliographers who have assisted in making this book more correct and
comprehensive than it otherwise would have been.
The Editor will be glad to have particulars (author, title, price, publisher,
and month of publication) of any work which may have been omitted. Infor-
mation as to each book should be given on a separate slip of paper or post-
card. It should be addressed to
The Editor of The English Catalogue of Books,
“ Publishers' Circular ” Office,
19, Adam Street, Strand,
London, W.C.
January, 1910.
THE NEXT FIVE-YEAR VOLUME
Next year (1911) we hope to publish our big volume, giving in ONE INDEX, under
author and subject, the books of 1906, 1907, 1908, 1909 and 1910.

HEREWITH we give our usual Analytical
Table showing the number of Books
recorded as published during the past
year, divided up into the various classes
of literature and separating new books
from new editions. It is worthy of note
that, in spite of a small decrease of 93 in
1908 as compared with 1907, there has
been an increase of 2,473 in the annual
output of books since the commencement
of the year 1906. The figures for the ten
years previous to 1909 are interesting as
showing the development of publishing
during the period. The manner in which
publishing is wrapped up with the
prosperity of the country is strikingly
shown by the slump during the period
of the South African War, and the
subsequent revival :-

1908 7,512 2,309
9,821
1909 8,446 2,279 10,725
This year, for the first time, the
number of books recorded is over 10,000,
the actual figures being 10,725. This is
an increase of 904 upon last year's
figures. In connection with this increase
it may be noted that the number of
new editions has decreased. In 1908" the
percentage of new editions was 2345 ;
this year it is down to 21'2—on the
whole a gratifying change.
Taking this year's output, and com-
paring it class by class with last year's,
there the following increases :-
Religion and Philosophy, 100; Fiction
and Juvenile Works, 94 ; Political and
Social, 81; Arts and Sciences, 37 ;
Voyages and Travels, 20; History and
Biography, 53 ; Year Books and Serials,
76; Medical Science, 37 ; Belles Lettres,
47 ;
and Miscellaneous, 478; while
there are decreases in the following
classes : Educational 8; Law, 17; and,
Poetry and Drama, 94.
The spring publishing season
unusually prolific and prolonged, but the
autumn season was marked by still
greater activity without any corres-
ponding prolongation, and the result
was an exceptionally congested period
for both those who sell and those who
buy books.
The Analytical Table supplies further
detailed information.

DIRECTORY OF PUBLISHERS.
Publishers have been invited to send us their Telegraphic Addresses and Telephone Numbers.
Those sent will be found below between square brackets [ ], and separated from each other by a semicolon (;)
The Editor will be glad to be notified of any inaccuracy in the following lists for correction in subsequent volumes
This list of Publishers, with their Addresses, has been compiled principally with a view to supplying
information regarding the books in the 1909 English Catalogue. This will explain the inclusion of some
firms in the list who can scarcely, in the strict acceptation of the term, be called Publishers, since the publicatio:1
of books forms only an occasional portion of their business.
