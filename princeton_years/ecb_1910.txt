PREFATORY NOTE
This seventy-fourth yearly issue of the English Catalogue of Books comprises
the titles (under authors, and subjects or titles) of works published during
1910 and also of some received too late for inclusion in the seventy-third
issue.
The main entry of each book begins with the author's surname (if known)
in heavy type. As an index to these Author" records, entries are also
made under the titles, commencing with its most important word (which usually
indicates the subject dealt with by each book), or with the first word; the
or word under which the main entry appears is printed in italics in
these index entries, thus giving a reference to the place where the full infor-
mation about a book may be found. Main entries and index entries are in
one alphabet.
name
Writers with compound names are entered under the last part of the
ilaine, e.g.:
Gould (Sabine Baring-)
and accordingly must be looked for in that order.
The publications of Learned Societies are recorded in an Appendix.
The names and addresses of the Publishers of Great Britain and Ireland
will be found at the end of the volume, followed by those of the principal
Publishers in the United States and Canada. The telegraphic and cable
addresses and telephone numbers have been added when known.
Following the .Preface is an analysis of the books of the year 1910, showing
in detail the number of works in each class of literature and giving the pro-
portions of new books and new editions.
Hearty thanks are due to many publishers, secretaries, librarians, authors,
and bibliographers who have assisted in making this book more correct and
comprehensive than it otherwise would have been.
The Editor will be glad to have particulars (author, title, price, publisher,
and month of publication) of any work which may have been omitted. Infor-
mation as to each book should be given on a separate slip of paper or post-
card. It should be addressed to-

Analysis of Books Published in
1910
The number of books recorded as pub-
lished during the year is 10,804. This is
an increase of 79 as compared with the
figures for 1909. This is gratifying in
view of the events of the year.
The
lamented death of Edward VII, and the
occurrence of two General Elections,
would have been sufficient reason for a
substantially decreased output; so that
the increase, small though it be, is highly
satisfactory.
The totals for the last few years are
striking evidence of the continued growth
of British publishing :-
Year. New books. New editions. Total.
1900
5,760 1,389 7,149
1901 4,955 1,089
6,044
1902 5,839 1,542 7,381
1903 6,699
1,682 8,381
1904 6,456 1,878
8,334
1905 6,817 1,435
1906 6,985
1,618
8,603
1907
7,701 2,213 9,914
1908
7,512 2,309
1909 8,446 2,279 10,725
1910 8,468 2,336 10,804
tional, 30; Law, 5 ; Social Science, 64;
Arts and Sciences, 53; Voyages and
Travels, 71; Poetry and Drama, 115 ;
Medicine, 51 ; while the following classes
show decreases :-Fiction, 48; History
and Biography, 53; Year Books, &c.,
29;
Belles Lettres, 32 ;
and Miscel-
laneous (Pamphlets, &c.), 190.
The
effect of the events noted above is
noticeable in the monthly totals, January,
May and December all being behind last
year's figures. The first two were made
up for by increases immediately after,
but the loss in the December total
could not of necessity be recovered in
the year under review.
The Analytical Table appended sup-
plies further fully detailed information.
It may be noted that this is the last
time this particular form of table will be
used. Commencing with 1911, the statis-
tics of book production will be tabulated
according to a scheme adopted by the
International Congress of Librarians at
Brussels in August, 1910.
Efforts are
being made to induce other countries
to use the same system. The new table
is more detailed and exact in its informa-
tion and arrangement, and will form a
useful basis for comparative statements
of the book production of the world.

9,821
Taking this year's output, and com-
paring it class by class with last year's,

Those sent will be found below between square brackets [ ], and separated from each other by a semicolon (;)
The Editor will be glad to be notified of any inaccuracy in the following lists for correction in subsequent volumes
This list of Publishers, with their Addresses, has been compiled principally with a view to supplying
information regarding the books in the 1910 English Catalogue. This will explain the inclusion of some
firms in the list who can scarcely, in the strict acceptation of the term, be called Publishers, since the publication
of books forms only an occasional portion of their business.

OF BOOKS,

THE
THE Published volumes of the ENGLISH CATALOGUE OF
BOOKS are, as The Athenæum said, “indispensable,” but
they do not go back beyond the year 1836. Librarians,
bibliographers and booksellers have always found the English
books covering the earlier part of the Nineteenth Century,
1801-1836, the most difficult to trace, the trade catalogues for
that period being very incomplete as regards the total number
of entries and insufficient as regards the individual entry.
a
It is now proposed to compile from the weekly and other
trade lists and other sources volume of the ENGLISH
CATALOGUE, covering the period in question on modern lines
-the author, title and subject entries in one alphabet - and
supplying as far as possible all the information which is wanting
in the “ London” and “ British” Catalogues.
This proposed volume will
complete the set of the ENGLISH
CATALOGUE from the beginning of the Nineteenth Century.
The volume, which will be issued uniformly with the other
volumes of the series, in half leather, will probably contain
about 800 pages, and will be supplied to subscribers whose orders
are received before May 31st, 1911, at the price of £3 3s. net,
After this date the price will be raised to £4 4s, net.
Although work on it has begun, the production being very
costly, its issue-which it is hoped will be in the Spring of
1912—must depend on the number of copies subscribed for by
May 31st, 1911.
