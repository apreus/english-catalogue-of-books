PREFATORY NOTE
This seventy-eighth yearly issue of THE ENGLISH CATALOGUE OF Books com-
prises the titles (under authors, and subjects or titles) of works published during
1914, and also of some received too late for inclusion in the seventy-seventh issue.
The main entry for each book begins with the author's surname (if known)
in heavy type. As an index to these " Author" records, entries are also made
under the titles, commencing with their most important words (which usually
indicate the subjects with which the books deal), or with the first words; the
name or word under which the main entry appears is printed in italics in these
index entries, thus giving a reference to the place where the full information
about a book may be found. Main entries and index entries are in one alphabet.
Writers with compound names are entered under the first part of the name,
e.g. :-
Baring-Gould (Sabine)
and accordingly must be looked for in that order. References are also made,
however, from the last part of the name.
The publications of learned Societies are recorded in an Appendix.
The names and addresses of the Publishers of Great Britain and Ireland,
followed by those of the principal publishers in the United States and Canada,
will be found at the end of the volume. The telegraphic and cable addresses
and telephone numbers have been added when known.
Following the Preface is an analysis of the books of the year 1914, showing
in detail the number of works in each class of literature, and giving the proportions
of new books, translations, pamphlets, and new editions.
Hearty thanks are due to many publishers, secretaries, librarians, authors
and bibliographers who have assisted in making this book more correct and
comprehensive than it would have been otherwise.
The Editor will be glad to have particulars (author, title, size, price, publisher,
and month of publication) of any work which may have been omitted. Information
regarding each book should be given on a separate slip of paper or postcard.
It should be addressed to The Editor of THE ENGLISH CATALOGUE OF BOOKS,
“Publishers' Circular" Office, 19, Adam Street, Strand, London, W.C.
JAMES DOUGLAS STEWART.

ANALYSIS OF BOOKS
PUBLISHED DURING 1914
)
IN common with other industries the
publishing trade has been affected by the
European War, but not so seriously as
might have been expected. The number
of books recorded as having been
published during 1914 is 11,537, a
decrease of 842 as compared with the
total of last year. Up to the end of
July, the figures for 1914 show a consider-
able increase over the previous year's
figures; but from August to October,
there is a slump which places 1914
below 1913.
A decided recovery is
noticeable in the totals for November and
December. But for the outbreak of war,
this year's publishing undoubtedly would
have shown an increase over any previous
year; and it is extremely satisfactory to
have so comparatively small a set-back
to record during the present period of
stress. At the same time, it must be
noted that the greater part of the recorded
decrease is to be found in the totals for
new books; and that the number of
pamphlets has increased this year. The
meaning of this is, of course, that the
average quality of book published during
1914 is somewhat lower than formerly ;
and the cause of this decline in average
quality is to be found in the natural
reluctance on the part of publishers to
place expensive works on a disturbed
market, combined with the issue of
numerous ephemeral works dealing with
the War.
The decrease this year has been spread
fairly evenly over the various classes
of literature. The principal decreases
are to be found in the following classes :
Philosophy, 101; Sociology, 222; Fine
Arts, 50 ; Fiction, 392 ; Description and
Travel, 167; and Biography, 101. The
principal increases are: Religion, 80 ;
Science, 108; and Literature, 32. A
new heading, Military and Naval, has
been introduced this year, in order to
provide a convenient heading for the
numerous works dealing with warfare
and the present War that are being
issued. It should be noted that in the
above classes, Education” includes
only books about educational theory and
practice, and not text-books on special
subjects, which are classed elsewhere;
and also that under “Music ” only works
about music are recorded.
Large though the yearly total is, it
would be possible to swell it to a much
greater figure by counting numerous
leaflets (Government and other),
ephemeral pamphlets, the publications
of borough councils and other local
government bodies, and musical texts.
While it is obvious that our total could
be increased greatly by the inclusion of
all these literary protozoa, the figures
would not represent so accurately the
book publishing activity of the United
Kingdom.
The following totals of the last ten
years are of considerable interest :-

In the following tables each book is
counted as one, whether it is in one or
more volumes. Serials that appear later
as a collected volume are counted as an
ordinary book on the appearance of that
volume ; so that, for example, the series
of “Statutory Rules and Orders” issued
by the Government, and amounting to
several hundred in the year, are counted
as one item on the appearance of the
annual collected volume.
The same
rule applies to volumes of magazines, &c.
Further de iled information regarding
the year's publishing is supplied by the
appended analytical tables.

DIRECTORY OF PUBLISHERS
Publishers are invited to send us their Telegraphic Addresses and Telephone Numbers.
Those sent will be found below between square brackets [ ], and separated from each other by a semicolon (;)
The Editor will be glad to be notified of any inaccuracy in the following lists for correction in subsequent volumes.
This list of Publishers, with their Addresses, has been compiled principally with a view to supplying
i formation regarding the books in the English Catalogue. This will explain the inclusion of some
firms in the list who can scarcely, in the strict acceptation of the term, be called Publishers, since thc publication
of books forms only an occasional part of their business.

THE
ENGLISH CATALOGUE
OF BOOKS
1801-1836
The published volumes of the ENGLISH CATALOGUE OF BOOKS do not go back
beyond the year 1836. Librarians, bibliographers and booksellers have always
found the English books covering the earlier part of the Nineteenth Century, 1801—1836,
the most difficult to trace, the trade catalogues for that period being very incomplete
as regards the total number of entries, and insufficient as regards the individual entry.
A volume of the English Catalogue, covering the period in question on modern
lines, has now been compiled from the weekly and other trade lists, and other
sources—the author, title, and subject entries in one alphabet-supplying as far
as possible all the information which is wanting in the “London " and "British"
Catalogues.
