PREFATORY NOTE
This seventy-seventh yearly issue of THE ENGLISH CATALOGUE OF Books com-
prises the titles (under authors, and subjects or titles) of works published during
1913, and also of some received too late for inclusion in the seventy-sixth issue.
The main entry for each book begins with the author's surname (if known)
in heavy type. As an index to these “ Author " records, entries are also made
under the titles, commencing with their most important words (which usually
indicate the subjects with which the books deal), or with the first words; the
name or word under which the main entry appears is printed in italics in these
index entries, thus giving a reference to the place where the full information
about a book may be found. Main entries and index entries are in one alphabet.
Writers with compound names are entered under the first part of the name,
e.g.: -
Baring-Could (Sabine)
and accordingly must be looked for in that order. References are also made,
however, from the last part of the name.
The publications of learned Societies are recorded in an Appendix.
The names and addresses of the Publishers of Great Britain and Ireland,
followed by those of the principal publishers in the United States and Canada,
will be found at the end of the volume. The telegraphic and cable addresses
and telephone numbers have been added when known.
Following the Preface is an analysis of the books of the year 1913, showing
in detail the number of works in each class of literature, and giving the proportions
of new books, translations, pamphlets, and new editions.
Hearty thanks are due to many publishers, secretaries, librarians, authors
and bibliographers who have assisted in making this book more correct and
comprehensive than it would have been otherwise.
The Editor will be glad to have particulars (author, title, size, price, publisher,
and month of publication) of any work which may have been omitted. Information
regarding each book should be given on a separate slip of paper or postcard.
It should be addressed to The Editor of THE ENGLISH CATALOGUE OF Books,
“ Publishers' Circular" Office, 19, Adam Street, Strand, London, W.C.

ANALYSIS
OF
BOOKS
PUBLISHED IN 1913
some
TH
"He number of books recorded as having
been published during 1913 is 12,379,
an increase of 312 on the total for 1912.
The monthly figures given in the second
part of the appended analytical table show
that the rate of production during the year
has been fairly steady from month to
month, with the exception of the com-
paratively empty months of August and
December. October, as usual, holds first
place with the total of 1,696, although this
figure falls short by 44 of the record total
noted last year.
January has also come
into the forefront as a busy month.
For the past three years this statistical
table has been constructed on the lines of
the classification scheme laid down by the
International Congress of Librarians at
Brussels in 1910, so that a comparison of
the numbers of books published in each
class of literature this year and last year
is possible. The principal increases this
year as compared with 1912 are to be
found in the following classes :--Religion,
91; Sociology, 216; Law, 15; Technology,
113; Medicine, etc., 38; Agriculture, etc.,
61; Business, 32; Games, etc., 22;
Fiction, 40; History, 32; and Travel and
Geography, 144. The principal decreases
are Science, 95; Domestic Arts, 54; and
Juvenile, 137. It should also be noted
that while the total number of publica-
tions has increased by 312, the number of
new editions has decreased by 32. It
should be noted that in the above classes
“ Education ” includes only books about
educational theory and practice, and not
text books on special subjects, which are
classed elsewhere; and also that under
“Music” only works about music are
recorded.
Large though the yearly total now is,
it would be possible to swell it to a much
greater figure by counting numerous
leaflets (Government and other), ephem-
eral pamphlets, the publications of
Borough Councils and other local govern-
ment bodies, and musical texts. The
latter alone would account for
thousands. As examples of the manner
in which the publishing activity of a
country may be entirely misrepresented
by the counting of all sorts of ephemeræ,
it may be mentioned that the yearly totals
for Japan and Russia for 1908 are given
as 36,046 and 23,852 respectively.
While it is thus obvious that our total
could be increased greatly by the inclusion
of all this literary protozoa, the figures
would not represent so accurately the
book publishing activity of the United
Kingdom.
The totals for the last ten years show
the striking development of British pub-
lishing :

In the following tables each book is
counted as one, whether it is in one or
more volumes. Serials that appear later
as a collected volume are counted as an
ordinary book on the appearance of that
volume; so that, for example, the series
Statutory Rules and Orders " issued
by the Government, and amounting to
several hundred in the year, are counted
one item on the appearance of the
annual collected volume. The same rule
applies to volumes of magazines, etc.
The analytical tables appended supply
further detailed information regarding the
year's publishing.

DIRECTORY OF PUBLISHERS
Publishers are invited to send us their Telegraphic Addresses and Telephone Numbers.
Those sent will be found below between square brackets [ ], and separated from each other by a semicolon (;)
The Editor will be glad to be notified of any inaccuracy in the following lists for correction in subsequent volumes.
This list of Publishers, with their Addresses, has been compiled principally with a view to supplying
information regarding the books in the English Catalogue. This will explain the inclusion of some
firms in the list who can scarcely, in the strict acceptation of the term, be called Publishers, since the publication
of books forms only an occasional part of their business.

THE
ENGLISH CATALOGUE
OF BOOKS
1801 - 1836
The published volumes of the ENGLISH CATALOGUE OF BOOKS do not go back
beyond the year 1836. Librarians, bibliographers and booksellers have always
found the English books covering the earlier part of the Nineteenth Century, 1801—1836,
the most difficult to trace, the trade catalogues for that period being very incomplete
as regards the total number of entries, and insufficient as regards the individual entry.
A volume of the English Catalogue, covering the period in question on modern
lines, is now being compiled from the weekly and other trade lists, and other
sources, the author, title, and subject entries in one alphabet-supplying as far
as possible all the information which is wanting in the "London" and " British”
Catalogues.
