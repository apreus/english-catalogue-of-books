PREFATORY NOTE
This seventy-second yearly issue of the English Catalogue of Books comprises the
titles in duplicate-namely, under author, and subject or title) of works published
during 1908, and also of some received too late for inclusion in the seventy-first issue.
The main entry of each book begins with the author's surname (if known) in
heavy type. As an index to these “Author” records, entries are also made under
the titles, commencing with its most important word (which usually indicates the
subject dealt with by each book), or with the first word; the word or name under
which the main entry appears is printed in italics in these index entries, thus giving
a reference to the place where the fullest information about a book may be found.
Main entries and index are in one alphabet.
To increase the usefulness of the Catalogue as a work of reference, the practice
has been adopted this year of giving in full the fore-names of authors, instead of
simply the initials as previously.
>
The publications of Learned Societies are recorded in an Appendix.
The names and addresses of the publishers of Great Britain and Ireland will be
found at the end of the volume, followed by those of the principal publishers in the
United States and in Canada. The telegraph and cable addresses and telephone
numbers have been added when known.
Following the Preface is an analysis of the books of this year, showing in detail
the number of works in each class of literature, and giving the proportions of new
books and new editions.
Hearty thanks are due to many publishers, secretaries, authors, and biblio-
graphers who have assisted in making this book more correct and comprehensive
than it otherwise would have been.
The Editor will be glad to have particulars of author, price, publisher, and
month of publication of any work which may have been omitted. Information as
to each book should be given on a separate slip of paper or postcard. It should be
addressed to-

ANALYSIS
OF 1908.
OF THE BOOKS
LIKE most businesses, publishing has
suffered a slight depression during the
year 1908, although it is still well above
any year previous to 1907. As will be
seen in the following table, the total
number of books recorded as published
in 1908 is 9,821, a decrease of 93 as
compared with 1907, but still more than
1,200 above any previous year.

This decrease is inconsiderable, but on
analysing the figures it will be seen that
there has also been a slight fall in the
average class of book published. Thus in
New Books (as opposed to New Editions)
there has been a decrease of 189 during
the year, while there has been an increase
of 96 in New Editions. That is to say, a
greater proportion of cheap reprints have
appeared, the actual percentage of these
for 1907 and 1908 being 22.3 and 23 5
respectively. This has been the case
especially in Fiction, Religion and Philo-
sophy, and Political and Social Economy ;
and an example is afforded by the Fiction
published during July, when 177 books
were issued, of which 88 or practically
50 per cent. were New Editions.
Taking the year's output class by
class there are the following decreases :
Religion, 28 ; Educational, 60; Political
and Social, 92 ; History, 13; Year
Books, 24; Medicine, 32; and Belles
Lettres, 79; while there are increases
in the following classes :
Fiction, 5;
Law, 17; Arts and Sciences, 55; Voy-
ages, 49 · Poetry, 42 ; and Miscellaneous
67. Other detailed information is sup-
plied by the Analytical Table.

"The Publishers' Circular" is read by booksellers' librarians, and
all connected with books and literature at home and abroad. It possesses
certain features which make it indispensable, and there is hardly a book-
seller in the country who does not read and study every number.
The up-to-date Trade information; the List of Books Wanted ; and
the detailed particulars of New Publications are some of the weekly
features which ensure its being bought and read by booksellers, librarians,
and large bookbuyers generally.
“The Publishers' Circular" is therefore an excellent medium for
Publishers' Announcements. An advertisement in its pages is the most
effective and economical means of reaching the men whose business
it is to buy books, and who respond to book advertising more than
any other class.
Booksellers having rare or second-hand books for disposal should
try the effect of an advertisement in “The Publishers' Circular.” We
are every day receiving fresh testimony as to the efficacy of our
advertising columns in this respect.

ment in this Catalogue, or write direct to

DIRECTORY OF PUBLISHERS.
Publishers have been invited to send us their Telegraphic Addresses and Telephone Numbers.
Those sent will be found below between square brackets [ ], and separated from each other by a semicolon (;).
The Editor will be glad to be notified of any inaccuracy in the following lists for correction in subsequent volumes.
This list of Publishers, with their Addresses, has been compiled principally with a view to supplying
information regarding the books in the 1908 English Catalogue. This will explain the inclusion of some
firms in the list who can scarcely, in the strict acceptation of the term, be called Publishers, since the publication
of books forms only an occasional portion of their business.
