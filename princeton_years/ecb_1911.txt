PREFATORY NOTE
This seventy-fifth yearly issue of THE ENGLISH CATALOGUE OF Books comprises
the titles (under authors, and subjects or titles) of works published during 1911,
and also of some received too late for inclusion in the seventy-fourth issue.
The commencement of a new five-yearly period of the Catalogue has been
taken as the opportunity to introduce some modifications in the details of the
entries, bringing the work more into line with modern international bibliographical
practice.
The main entry for each book begins with the author's surname (if known)
in heavy type. As an index to these “Author” records, entries are also made
under the titles, commencing with their most important words (which usually
indicate the subjects with which the books deal), or with the first words; the
name or word under which the main entry appears is printed in italics in these
index entries, thus giving a reference to the place where the full information
about a book may be found. Main entries and index entries are in one alphabet.
Writers with compound names are entered under the first part of the name,
e.g..
Baring-Gould (Sabine)
and accordingly must be looked for in that order. References are also made,
however, from the last part of the name.
The publications of learned Societies are recorded in an Appendix.
The names and addresses of the Publishers of Great Britain and Ireland,
followed by those of the principal publishers in the United States and Canada.
will be found at the end of the volume. The telegraphic and cable addresses
and telephone numbers have been added when known.
Following the Preface is an analysis of the books of the year 1911, showing
in detail the number of works in each class of literature, and giving the proportions
of new books, translations, pamphlets, and new editions.
Hearty thanks are due to many publishers, secretaries, librarians, authors
and bibliographers who have assisted in making this book more correct and
comprehensive than it otherwise would have been.
The Editor will be glad to have particulars (author, title, size, price, publisher,
and month of publication) of any work which may have been omitted. Information
regarding each book should be given on a separate slip of paper or postcard.
It should be addressed to The Editor of THE ENGLISH CATALOGUE OF Books,
“ Publishers' Circular” Office, 19, Adam Street, Strand, London, W.C.

ANALYSIS OF BOOKS
PUBLISHED IN 1911
The number of books recorded as having
been published during the year is 10,914,
an increase of 110 on the total for 1910.
This is the highest total ever recorded
for a year's publishing in the United
Kingdom. Owing to the events of the
year, the rate of production has not been
so steady as in average years, and the
monthly totals vary from 673 in June
(the Coronation month) to 1,527 (a
record) in October. The following are
the totals for the last ten years and last
year :
New
books.
Year.
at Brussels, in August, 1910. The new
table is more detailed and exact than the
one hitherto used.
So far as the two tables can be com-
pared, the increase appears to be dis-
tributed evenly over all classes of litera-
ture. As year-books and pamphlets are
now distributed over subjects, and not
counted as separate classes as formerly,
the exact figures of increases or decreases
cannot be supplied. The largest increases
have occurred in the following classes :
Philosophy and Religion; Science and
Technology; History and Biography ;
and Poetry and Drama; while it is
probable that there have been slight
decreases (omitting year-books, &c.), in
Educational and Philology, and Medicine.
It should be noted that these figures
do not include numerous ephemeral
pamphlets, government leaflets and
musical texts. If these were included, a
large increase in the total would result;
but the figures would not so accurately
represent the book publishing activity of
the United Kingdom.
The analytical tables appended supply
further detailed information regarding
the year's publishing.

Publishers are invited to send us their Telegraphic Addresses and Telephone Numbers.
Those sent will be found below between square brackets ( ), and separated from each other by a semicolon (;)
The Editor will be glad to be notified of any inaccuracy in the following lists for correction in subsequent volumes.
This list of Publishers, with their Addresses, has been compiled principally with a view to supplying
information regarding the books in the English Catalogue. This will explain the inclusion of some
firms in the list who can scarcely, in the strict acceptation of the term, be called Publishers, since the publication
of books forms only an occasional part of their business.

THE
HE published volumes of the ENGLISH CATALOGUE
OF BOOKS do not go back beyond the year 1836.
Librarians, bibliographers and booksellers have always
found the English books covering the earlier part of the
Nineteenth Century, 1801—1836, the most difficult to trace,
the trade catalogues for that period being very incomplete
as regards the total number of entries, and insufficient
as regards the individual entry.
A volume of the English CataLOGUE, covering the
period in question on modern lines, is now being compiled
from the weekly and other trade lists, and other sources
—the author, title and subject entries in one alphabet-
supplying as far as possible all the information which is
wanting in the “ London ” and “ British ” Catalogues.
