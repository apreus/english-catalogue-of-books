PREFATORY NOTE
This seventy-ninth yearly issue of THE ENGLISH CATALOGUE OF Books com-
prises the titles (under authors, and subjects or titles) of works published during
1915, and also of some received too late for inclusion in the seventy-eighth issue.
The main entry for each book begins with the author's surname (if known)
in heavy type. As an index to these “ Author " records, entries are also made
under the titles, commencing with their most important words (which usually
indicate the subjects with which the books deal), or with the first words; the
name or word under which the main entry appears is printed in italics in these
index entries, thus giving a reference to the place where the full information
about a book may be found. Main entries and index entries are in one alphabet.
Writers with compound names are entered under the first part of the name,
e.g. : -
Baring-Gould (Sabine)
and accordingly must be looked for in that order. References are also made,
however, from the last part of the name.
The publications of learned Societies are recorded in an Appendix.
The names and addresses of the Publishers of Great Britain and Ireland,
followed by those of the principal publishers in the United States and Canada,
will be found at the end of the volume. The telegraphic and cable addresses
and telephone numbers have been added when known.
Following the Preface is an analysis of the books of the year 1915, showing
in detail the number of works in each class of literature, and giving the proportions
of new books, translations, pamphlets, and new editions.
Hearty thanks are due to many publishers, secretaries, librarians, authors
and bibliographers who have assisted in making this book more correct and
comprehensive than it would have been otherwise,
The Editor will be glad to have particulars (author, title, size, price, publisher,
and month of publication) of any work which may have been omitted. Information
regarding each book should be given on a separate slip of paper or postcard.
It should be addressed to The Editor of THE ENGLISH CATALOGUE OF BOOKS,
“Publishers' Circular" Office, 19, Adam Street, Strand, London, W.C.

The Editor will be glad to be notified of any inaccuracy in the following lists for correction in subsequent volumes.
This list of Publishers, with their Addresses, has been compiled principally with a view to supplying
information regarding the books in the English Catalogue. This will explain the inclusion of some
firms in the list who can scarcely, in the strict acceptation of the term, be called Publishers, since the publication
