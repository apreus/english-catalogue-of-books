PREFATORY NOTE
THIS eighty-sixth yearly issue of THE ENGLISH CATALOGUE OF Books comprises
the titles (under authors, and subjects or titles) of works published during 1922,
and also of some received too late for inclusion in the eighty-fifth issue.
The main entry for each book begins with the author's surname (if known)
in heavy type. As an index to these Author" records, entries are also made
under the titles, commencing with their most important words (which usually
indicate the subjects with which the books deal), or with the first words. Many
other index entries are also made under subjects in order to make the CATALOGUE
of use to persons in search of the literature of a particular topic, as well as to
those requiring a particular book. The name or word under which the main
entry appears is printed in italics in these index entries, thus giving a reference
to the place where the full information about a book may be found. Main
entries and index entries are in one alphabet.
e.g.:
Writers with compound names are entered under the first part of the name,
Ashley-Cooper (F. S.)
and accordingly must be looked for in that order. References are also made,
however, from the last part of the name.
The publications of learned Societies are recorded in an Appendix.
The names and addresses of the Publishers of Great Britain and Ireland,
followed by those of the principal publishers in the United States and Canada,
will be found at the end of the volume. The telegraphic and cable addresses
and telephone numbers have been added when known.
In response to a published request, particulars of a number of British Agents.
of American and Colonial publishers have been received, and these have been
added to the names of the firms they represent.
Following the Preface is an analysis of the books of the year 1922, showing
in detail the number of works in each class of literature, and giving the proportions
of new books, translations, pamphlets, and new editions.
Every effort has been made to obtain the full particulars of the books noted.
Special enquiries were made in every case where information was deficient; and
most publishers courteously responded. In the cases where entries have been
included without prices, the fault lies with the publishers concerned.
Hearty thanks are due to the many publishers, secretaries, librarians, authors
and bibliographers who have assisted in making this book more correct and
comprehensive than it would have been otherwise.
The Editor will be glad to have particulars (author, title, size, price, publisher,
and month of publication) of any work which may have been omitted. Information
regarding each book should be given on a separate slip of paper or postcard.
It should be addressed to The Editor of THE ENGLISH CATALOGUE OF BOOKS,
"Publishers' Circular " Office, 19, Adam Street, Strand, London, W.C.2.
& I HAV
January, 1923.

ERRATA
The publishers of Green's "Coccidae of Ceylon
Coccidae of Ceylon " (p. 119), and Hooker's
"Icones plantarum" (p. 135), are Messrs. DULAU & Co., LTD., and not Messrs.
Reeve, as stated.

ANALYSIS OF BOOKS
PUBLISHED DURING 1922 IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
THE PUBLISHERS' CIRCULAR records a total
of 10,842 books as having been published
in the United Kingdom during the year
1922.
This is a decrease of 184 as compared
with the total for 1921, but it will be seen
from the analytical tables appended that
this decrease has been entirely in the issue
of "New Editions." It is remarkable
that the number of "New Books " pub-
lished during the year is only three less
than the number published during 1921.
The table showing the number of books
published each month reveals a striking
difference in the seasonal distribution of
publishing activity. The first months of
the current year fell far below the corre-
sponding period of 1921; while the later
months, notably October and November
with totals of over twelve hundred each,
rose to a height not approached in 1921.
The following table shows how the cur-
rent year commenced by being behind and
ended by being in front of 1921 in the
number of books issued :-
Jan.-June.
1921.
1922.
5,474 4,855
...
July-Dec.
1921.
1922.
5,552 5,987
...
Whether or not this intense seasonal
activity is good business from the pub-
lishers' point of view is for them to de-
cide. There is no doubt whatever that it
is a serious drawback from the point of
view of book-buyers (we mean the larger,
constant book-buyers), reviewers, and last
-though by no means least-readers.
Not only do books pour in a great flood
from the publishers during certain
months of the year, but many of the best
books are kept back to join this flood.
The effect of this is obvious. Many good
books are submerged that would have a
greater success if they appeared in less
crowded times; and while during part of
the year our buyers, reviewers and readers
are overwhelmed by a flood with which
they are unable to cope, at other times
they are left with an unsatisfying trickle.
Last year there were signs that the "sea-
sons were disappearing in a more con-
stant level throughout the year, but this
year they are back again with renewed
vigour. No doubt the trade strikes
during the early part of the year have had
a good deal to do with this.
The "Classified Analysis
99 shows how
the totals for the various kinds of books
vary from those of last year. The follow-
""
ing classes show appreciable increases:
Poetry and Drama (+ 85), Games, Sports,
etc. (+74), General Works (+ 64), and
Philology (+41). Decreases are to be
noted in History (-106), Description and
Travel (-98), Military and Naval (-97),
Medicine (-76), Technology (-76), Edu-
cation (54), and Religion (-32). The
minor increases and decreases are shown
by the Table. The drops in History,
Military and Naval, and Medicine are no
doubt due to the waning influence of the
war on those subjects. The most striking
increase is that in Poetry and Drama,
again largely due to the appearance of
many small booklets of verse.
It is interesting to compare the order
in which the totals of the chief classes
of literature appear this year and in the
last pre-war year, because these totals
furnish a rough indication of the pre-
ferences of the reading public :—
1914.
(1) Fiction
(2) Religion
(3) Science
(4) Sociology
(5) Technology
(6) Poetry
(7) Juvenile
(8) Description

Further detailed information regarding
the year's publishing is supplied by the
appended analytical tables. It should be
noted that "Education" includes only
books about educational theory and prac-
tice, and not text-books on special sub-
jects which are classed under their


## p. (#8) ##################################################

66
subjects; and that all publications of 48 |
pages or less are counted as pamph-
lets." It would be possible to swell the
totals to an enormous extent by counting
ali kinds of printed matter (such as
ephemeral pamphlets and leaflets, local
government publications, musical texts,
etc.), but the purpose of this table is to
represent the book publishing activity of
the United Kingdom. This should be
noted in comparing the figures with those
of other countries, in some of which single
copies of newspapers are counted sepa-
rately. In these tables each complete pub-
lication is counted as one, whether it is
in one or more volumes. Serials that
appear later as a collected volume are
counted as an ordinary book on the
appearance of that volume; so that, for
example, the series of " Statutory Rules
and Orders" issued by the Government,
and amounting to hundreds in the year,
are counted as one item on the appear-
ance of the annual collected volume.

DIRECTORY OF PUBLISHERS
Publishers are invited to send us their Telegraphic Addresses and Telephone Numbers.
Those sent will be found below between square brackets [ ], and separated from each other by a semicolon ( ;).
The Editor will be glad to be notified of any inaccuracy in the following lists for correction in subsequent volumes.
This list of Publishers, with their Addresses, has been compiled principally with a view to supplying
information regarding the books in the English Catalogue. This will explain the inclusion of some firms
in the list who can scarcely, in the strict acceptation of the term, be called Publishers, since the publication
of books forms only an occasional part of their business.
