PREFATORY NOTE
THIS sixty-seventh yearly issue of the English Catalogue of Books comprises the
titles of works published during 1903, also of some received too late for inclusion
in the sixty-sixth issue.
Titles and index are in one alphabet.
The main entry of each work begins
with the author's surname (if given on the title page) in heavy type. As an index
to these 'Author' records, the title, commencing with its most important word or
with its first word, is repeated in the same alphabet, with that word in italics,
which in the main entry is in thick type.
"
The Transactions' of Learned Societies are recorded in an Appendix, as also
the 'Series' and 'Libraries' issued by some publishers.
The names and addresses of the publishers of Great Britain and Ireland will be
found at the end of the volume, followed by those of the principal publishers in the
United States and in Canada. The telegraph and cable addresses and telephone
numbers have been added when known.
Hearty thanks are due to many publishers, secretaries, authors, and biblio-
graphers who have assisted in making this book more correct and comprehensive than
it otherwise would have been.
The Editor will be glad to have particulars of author, price, publisher, and month
of publication of any work which may have been omitted. Information as to
each book should be on a separate slip of paper, the size of a large card. It should
be addressed to

DIRECTORY OF PUBLISHERS
All the Publishers have been invited by post to send us their Telegraphic Address and Telephone Number.
Those sent will be found below between square brackets [ ], and separated from each other by a
semicolon (;).
This list of Publishers, with their Addresses, has been principally compiled with a view to supplying informa-
tion regarding the books in the 1908 English Catalogue. This will explain the inclusion of many firms in the
list who can scarcely, in the strict acceptation of the term, be called Publishers, since the publication of books
forms only an occasional portion of their business.
