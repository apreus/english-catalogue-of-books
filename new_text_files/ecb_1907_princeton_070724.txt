THE
CATALOGUES connected with it having become the property of a NEW COMPANY
(embracing in its Directorate the names of some of its original founders nearly seventy
years ago), the Directors have decided to make an exceptional offer of the present
small stock of Catalogues. Accordingly they have fixed the price so low that no one
interested in the literature of the Victorian Era of the past century, no Bookseller,
Publisher, Author or Librarian need be without a set so far as they can now be supplied.
The First Volume of the English Catalogue, from 1835 to 1862, and its
accompanying Index Volume are out of print and scarce.
The Second Volume, 1863 to 1871 inclusive, is also out of print and scarce.

The following are the Volumes which are now available :-
Yolume II. THE INDEX OF SUBJECTS only. Contains the years 1856 to 1875 inclusive.
N.B.-It contains 1856 to 1873 in one alphabet and 1874 and 1875 in separate alphabets (including 20 years),
thus forming a reasonable substitute for part of the out of print Vol. I. and the whole of Vol. II.

A NOTE ON
"THE ENGLISH CATALOGUE"
PAST AND PRESENT
THE ENGLISH CATALOGUE OF BOOKS has
for many years been one of the institutions
of the bibliographical world, and it may
not be without interest to repeat Mr.
E. Marston's sketch of its development.
Among the earliest catalogues known
were those compiled by Robert Clavell,
which he called "Term Catalogues," be-
cause he seems to have issued them in
separate volumes at Michaelmas Term,
Hilary Term, Easter Term, and Trinity
Term of each year from the year 1666 to
1709. John Dunton says of him: "Mr.
Robert Clavell is a great dealer, and has
deservedly gained himself the reputation
of a just man. Dr. Barlow, Bishop of
Lincoln, used to call him the 'honest
bookseller.' He has been Master of the
of
Company
1699)."
volume of the "London Catalogue"
series was published in 1855. It was
subsequently incorporated with "The
English Catalogue in 1864.
The following, then, may be termed
the genealogy of "The English Cata-
logue":

Two other catalogues which are also
among the earliest known are Maun-
sell's Catalogue of English Books, 1595,"
and William Jaggard's "Catalogue of
such English Bookes, as lately have bene
and now are in printing for publication,"
1618-19.
Clavell's term catalogues ceased
publication in 1709. In 1773 there was
published "The London Catalogue of
Books in all Languages, Arts, and
Sciences that have been printed in Great
Britain since the year 1700" (no pub-
lisher). There were other catalogues
published during the eighteenth century,
but this "London Catalogue" claims to
contain "upwards of 1,500 books that
have never been in any other catalogue."
Then came A General Catalogue
of Books in all Languages, Arts, and
Sciences printed in Great Britain and
published in London from the year 1700
to 1786. Classed under the several
Branches of Literature and Alpha-
betically Disposed under each Head with
their Sizes and Prices. London: Printed
for W. Bent, Paternoster Row, 1786."
The next volume again is called
"The London Catalogue of Books,
Selected from the General Catalogue
published in 1786, and including
Additions and Alterations to September,
1791."
The next volume is brought down to
1811, and was published that year by
W. Bent. The next volumes bear the
dates 1811, 1814, 1818, 1822, and 1827.
Then follows a volume compiled and
published by Robert Bent, probably son
of W. Bent, in 1839. The next by
Thomas Hodgson in 1846. The last

It will be seen from this brief outline,

that "The English Catalogue" can trace
its ancestry back for more than three
hundred years.
THE PRESENT YEAR.
This year has been by far the busiest
in the annals of English publishing. No
fewer than 9,914 books are recorded in
this volume; or 1,311 more than in “The
English Catalogue" for 1906. The increase
has been spread over the entire year, and
consequently no especial activity has
been noticed in either of the main
publishing seasons. The classified in-
creases are: Religion and Philosophy,
213; Law, 145; Arts and Sciences,
610; Voyages and Travels, 163; History
and Biography, 232; Poetry and Drama,
69; Medicine, 63; Essays, &c., 29;

Miscellaneous, 116. Social Economy, &c.,
and Year Books, &c., remain stationary ;
while decreases are recorded in Education
and in Fiction. Reprints have been
more plentiful this year, owing to in-
creased activity in the publication of
cheap series. Other detailed informa-
tion regarding the publications of the
year will be found in the Analytical
Table.

PREFATORY NOTE
THIS seventy-first yearly issue of the English Catalogue of Books comprises the
titles (in duplicate—namely, under author, and subject or title) of works published
during 1907, and also of some received too late for inclusion in the seventieth issue.
The main entry of each book begins with the author's surname (if known) in
heavy type. As an index to these "Author" records, entries are also made under
the titles, commencing with the most important word (which usually indicates the
subject dealt with by each book), or with the first word; the word or name under
which the main entry appears is printed in italics in these index entries, thus giving
a reference to the place where the fullest information about a book may be found.
Main entries and index are in one alphabet.
The publications of Learned Societies are recorded in an Appendix.
The names and addresses of the publishers of Great Britain and Ireland will be
found at the end of the volume, followed by those of the principal publishers in the
United States and in Canada. The telegraph and cable addresses and telephone
numbers have been added when known.
A brief historical note on the development of the English Catalogue, and an
analysis of the books of this year, follow the preface.
Hearty thanks are due to many publishers, secretaries, authors, and biblio-
graphers who have assisted in making this book more correct and comprehensive
than it otherwise would have been.
The Editor will be glad to have particulars of author, price, publisher, and
month of publication of any work which may have been omitted. Information as
to each book should be given on a separate slip of paper or postcard. It should be
addressed to
The Editor of The English Catalogue of Books,
"Publishers' Circular" Office,
January, 1908,
St. Dunstan's House, Fetter Lane,
London, E.C.

DIRECTORY OF PUBLISHERS
Publishers have been invited to send us their Telegraphic Addresses and Telephone Numbers.
Those sent will be found below between square brackets [ ], and separated from each other by a semicolon ( ;)
This list of Publishers, with their Addresses, has been principally compiled with a view to supplying
information regarding the books in the 1907 English Catalogue. This will explain the inclusion of many
firms in the list who can scarcely, in the strict,acceptation of the term, be called Publishers, since the publication
of books forms only an occasional portion of their business.
