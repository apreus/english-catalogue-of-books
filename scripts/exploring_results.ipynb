You could start by exploring the dataframes, where the strings have been parsed out into specific fields, rather than thinking about whole entries. Explore the results we have and find something you think is interesting. If you can't think of a way to use that feature to explore the data, run it by one of your colleagues and see what they think. Your team is always your best asset!\n",
    "2. Use that view of the data to characterize what's working and what isn't. In this case it was clear that unreasonably short or long strings were going to have some errors, so I was able to look at those entries to see where there might be problems in the existing process.\n",
    "3. Find out which part of the existing code is relevant for the feature you're interested in. This part is probably going to be hard if you haven't had a much experience with programming. If it isn't obvious how to proceed after you've had a look at some of the scripts, ask me or Anna how to do what you want to do.\n",
